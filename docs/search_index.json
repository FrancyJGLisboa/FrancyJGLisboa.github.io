This online book documents the major steps that have been taken so far in regard to this migration. The book describes the main institutional actors involved in the migration as well as the AQUASTAT - SWS resources (code lists, datasets, data tables) that have been created to support the SWS plugins (R modules) to meet technical unit requirements. Furthermore, the SWS plugins are presented in the form of chapters providing detailed description of their workflows involving input -&gt; processing -&gt; output as well as results showing whether the modules have lived up to expectations.

["migration-actors.html", "Migration actors", " Migration actors Any migration into the SWS requires the interaction between at least three actors: The technical unit interested in automating either some or all its analytical processes in the SWS. The technical unit can be treated as client demanding services from the counterparts responsible for the implementation of its data and statistical assets in the SWS. Therefore, a successful AQUASTAT - SWS migration depends on the coordination between the technical division and other parts. In the AQUASTAT - SWS migration framework the technical unit is called AQUASTAT and is represented by: Virginie Gillet AQUASTAT coordination consultant (CBLD) Jippe Hoogeveen Technical Officer (CBL) The ESS - Methodological Innovation Team (ESS - SWS) responsible for the implementation and documentation of the required statistical processes. From the ESS - SWS team the focal points for AQUASTAT - SWS migration are: Francy Lisboa Agronomist/Statistician (ESSD) Carola Fabi Statistician (ESSD) The CIO - SWS the primary backend and frontend maintainer of the SWS and responsible for the implementation and documentation of non-statistical processes (IT infrastructure). The CIO - SWS team have as interlocutors: Enrico Anello Full Stack Developer (CIO) John Rowell Information Technology Officer (CIO) "],
["new-aquastat-methodology.html", "New AQUASTAT methodology Data Collection Questionnaire The current AQUASTAT information management", " New AQUASTAT methodology The book focuses on SWS statistical processes on progress. However, for those interested, AQUASTAT has a dedicated FAO website where the new methodology for data collection and data management can be accessed. The next sections summarize the AQUASTAT data collection and information management methodology. Data Collection Data collection relies on a network of AQUASTAT national correspondents in charge of the provision of official national data; As of January of 2019, 107 countries have nominated AQUASTAT national correspondents as requested by FAO Land and Water Division between April-May 2018; Alternate correspondents from different agencies are also used to improve the data collection; The annual Water and Agriculture questionnaire was cleared by FAO Office of the Chief Statistician (OCS); The Questionnaire compiles water and irrigation statistics collected by National Correspondents and is sent out the first semester of each year. Questionnaire The Water and Agriculture questionnaire has the following characteristics: Three introductory sections: Cover page, Instructions, Definitions; One data reporting section, including national data on water withdrawal, dam capacity, municipal wastewater, irrigation and drainage; Two Supplementary Information sections: Metadata, Feedback. In addition, to the annual data collection, a more complete questionnaire will be sent every 5 years to populate other AQUASTAT databases.

["aquastat-in-sws-proposed-dataflow.html", "AQUASTAT in SWS: proposed dataflow", " AQUASTAT in SWS: proposed dataflow AQUASTAT dataflow will predominatly be triggered by the filling and compilation of the Water and Agriculture questionnaire by the AQUASTAT network of National Correspondents. The CIO - SWS counterpart is the responsible for creating tailored questionnaire harvesters to automatically extract data from filled questionnaires and output it as an SWS compliant dataset. Once in the SWS, the technical will benefit from the tools and other features that have been developed to make the AQUASTAT dataflow as seamless as possible. On this basis, the flowchart below gives the AQUASTAT dataflow that has been fostered by the ESS - SWS team. Figure .: Proposed AQUATAST - SWS dataflow Notice that the questionnaire harvester produced by CIO - SWS counterpart represents the first contact of the questionnaire - based data with the SWS. The harvester outputs an SWS compliant dataset that goes through the chain of SWS processes where inputs and outputs datasets are also adhering to SWS standards. Apart from the questionnaire harvesting, the processes in green are those performed by AQUASTAT modules already operating in the QA environment in the SWS. The faoswsAquastatUpdate module is yet to be built after the final endorsement of the faoswsAquastaBaseline output by the technical unit. Again, the aquastat_baseline dataset is going to be the starting point for the periodical updates of the AQUASTAT data obtained from questionnaires and other sources. Therefore, the plan is that whenever the technical unit needs to update the AQUASTAT dataset, the faoswsAquastatUpdate executes on the latest version of the aquastat_baseline dataset. "],
["sws-resources.html", "SWS resources Code lists Data tables Datasets", " SWS resources SWS resources are R modules, data tables, data sets, and code lists comprising a migration framework. Data tables are typically used as auxiliary data to help R modules to achieve their goals, often a long-format four-to-six dimensional data set. The dimensions of the data sets are defined by statistical domain-specific code lists (reference lists) containing codes and descriptions. Therefore, data sets are primarily used to store code list - referenced values as either input and/or output in the SWS. The generic relationship among data table, data sets, and R modules is given as follow: Figure .: Generic data table, dataset, and R module relationship in the SWS context Code lists Code lists, also called reference lists in SWS parlance, are the dimensions making up the data sets that are designed by the user to store analytical results from SWS modules. The dimensions are statistical - domain specific and are defined by the technical unit in order to reflect its needs regarding data collection, processing, and dissemination while meeting FAO standards. Each data set dimension has a set of codes and their associated descriptions. Thus, code lists serve to the purpose of standardization, visualization, and metadata by associating standardized codes to standardized names in the SWS data set outputs. A typical SWS compliant data set has, therefore, the following dimensions/reference lists: Geographic area. Representing a spatial scale the information is measured at. For example, countries, territories, regional aggregates, regional special groups aggregates, global aggregates. In SWS, the geographic area dimension used by AQUASTAT data sets is named geographicAreaM49. Items. Those one wants to take a measurement from. For example, commodities, commodity groups, land use types, species, etc. Typical item dimension names are measuredItemCPC, *measuredItemHS, measuredItem. The AQUASTAT - SWS framework does not include item code/reference list. Elements. Often representing a measurement that can be taken across different items. For example, area, production, share. In SWS, the element dimension/code list used by AQUASTAT aquastat_legacy dataset is named aquastatElement. The aquastatElement variable in the aquastat_legacy dataset is not SWS compliant. However, the SWS reference list used by the system to map out element codes to definitions is also named aquastatElement. It is OK to keep aquastatElement as variable name in the legacy data, but the idea is that, for the aquastat_baseline dataset, all variables names should adhere to SWS standards. Time (the time unit the data is displayed for: year, months, etc). In SWS, the time dimension used by AQUASTAT data sets is named timePointYears. Flag (A standardized label indicating origin and/or nature of a number in the data set, e.g. (Official number)). In SWS, the flag dimension used by AQUASTAT data sets is named flagObservationStatus. Please check the OCS statistical standards and the flags document to understand the flagObservationStatus rational and obtain the description of flags. Figure .: Description of flag of observations in the SWS Method (A standardized label indicating method utilized to obtain a number in the data set. In SWS, the method dimension used by AQUASTAT data sets is named flagMethod. Please check the OCS statistical standards and the flags document to understand the flagMethod rational and obtain the description of flags. Figure .: Description of flag of methods in the SWS Figure .: Typical dimensions (SWS code/reference lists) composing a AQUASTAT SWS - compliant input/output dataset. Data tables Data tables are mainly used to store information helping R modules to output analytical results. Information in data tables can be of a number of types. For example, conversion factors, arithmetic formulas, mapping between flags, mapping between international classifications, etc. In SWS hierarchy. all data tables reside in a given statistical domain. In the AQUASTAT - SWS migration framework, the data tables are in the Aquastat domain. Below is a list of current available and filled data tables in the Aquastat domain: aquastat_reference. A data table listing AQUASTAT element codes, names, dissemination status, variable/indicator status, sources, long-term avergae variable status, the primary variable rule status. aquastat_faostat_mapping. A data table mapping out AQUASTAT elements to FAOSTAT elements. aquastat_sources. A data table storing AQUASTAT data source references. calculation_rule. A data table storing the pre-defined calculation rules used to obtain AQUASTAT indicators/derived variables. aquastat_validation. A data table storing the a set of logic tests to be applied to AQUASTAT inputs and outputs for the purpose of quality assurance and quality check Global Dam Reservoir. A data table storing national expert - provided information on the major Dams at the country level. Global Map of Irrigated Area. A data table storing information for the update of spatial representation of irrigated areas at the national level. Global Map of Irrigated Area/subnational. A data table storing information for the update of spatial representation of irrigated areas at the national and sub-national levels. Variable names (aka column names) in SWS data tables are more flexible in terms of the names they can take than SWS datasets. One can find SWS data tables naming variables as element_code, element_code_sws, element_code_faostat, etc. Likewise, columns describing countries across different data table may have different classification systems. This flexibility in data tables is benefitial as it allows to accomodate different auxiliary information. Datasets Datasets in the SWS are interchangeably used as module inputs/outputs and are composed by dimensions (aka reference/code lists). Because SWS datasets contain code lists following international standards as dimensions, there is little space for variation of dimension names across SWS datasets for the sake of standardization. In the AQUASTAT - SWS framework, the available data sets are: aquastat_legacy. Currently named as aquastat_enr, the aquastat_legacy is an SWS dataset with the legacy data from the ‘Old’ AQUASTAT working system. The CIO - SWS has migrated the aquastat_legacy dataset into the SWS in order to be used as the starting point for the faoswsAquastatBaseline module (see 1). The aquastat_legacy dataset is the bare minimum of AQUASTAT, meaning that none analytical process has been applied to it, including the calculation of AQUASTAT indicators (aka derived variables) and imputations. Therefore, the aquastat_legacy is only used to derive the aquastat_baseline dataset, which in turn, is going to be the new AQUASTAT benchmark in the SWS and dataset to be updated after every end of questionnaire - based data collection - compilation cycle. Figure .: Snapshot of the aquastat_legacy dataset in SWS. aquastat_baseline. An SWS dataset output from the faoswsAquastatBaseline module which is going to be periodically updated by the new data made available after data collection - compilation cycle. With the new data, the aquastat_baseline dataset will be the input of a SWS module called faoswsAquastatUpdate which will add these new data to the aquastat_baseline dataset. Figure .: Snapshot of the aquastat_baseline dataset as the benchmark (input) for the future updates of AQUASTAT data collected via questionnaire For the moment, the aquastat_legacy and aquastat_baseline datasets are using the same SWS element reference list called aquastatElement, which does not align with SWS standards. Therefore, for the sake of standadization, the AQUASTAT element reference list in the SWS MUST be named measuredElement at some point in the future. "],
["aquastat-elements.html", "AQUASTAT Elements International Classification Systems The SWS aquastat_reference data table", " AQUASTAT Elements Chapter 1 will treat the module as well as its data sets and data tables in more details. However, after describing the current SWS resources involved in the AQUASTAT - SWS migration framework, it is important to have a look at how the technical unist references its data and the list of the data collected, processed, and disseminated. International Classification Systems AQUASTAT datasets use the following international classification systems to reference its elements: The International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities: ISIC4; The System of Environmental-Economic Accounting for Water: SEEA-Water for water resources and withdrawals; The World Census of Agriculture 2020: WCA (Volume 1), for irrigation definitions. The SWS aquastat_reference data table With the agreement of the AQUASTAT focal point, the ESS - SWS team has adapted and updated a data table in the SWS called aquastat_reference with the following information on AQUASTAT elements: element_code. The AQUASTAT variable and indicator codes present in the SWS code list aquastatElement; element_name. The description of the AQUASTAT variables and indicators; disseminated. Column indicating whether the variable/indicator is for dissemination (D) or internal use (I); calculated. Column indicating whether the variable is an ordinary variable (V) or an indicator (calculated variable) (C); source. Column with the source description of AQUASTAT variables/indicators. AQUASTAT. Ordinary variable collected by AQUASTAT; DERIVED. Indicator calculated from ordinary variables; FAOSTAT. variable or indicator collected from FAOSTAT database; WORLD BANK. variable or indicator collected from the World Bank; ILO. variable or indicator collected from the International Labor Organization; JMP(WHO/UNICEF). variable or indicator collected from the World Health Organization/UNICEF. CRU CL 2.0. Variable collected from the Tyndall Center for Climate Change Research. UNDP. Variable collected from United Nations Development Programme. lta. A binary variable indicating whether the element is a long-term average variable. PR. A binary variable indicating whther the element is part of the validation rules where the primary rule approach can be applied. In the validation_rule data table, some of the expressions are OK for the application of the primary variable rules. The rule grounds on the principle that some indicators have a primary variable that can be used as a substitute in case iof the indicator value is missing. This approach only applies to indicators obtained from addition and subtraction expressions. Therefore, the PR variable in the aquastat_reference data table is used to help the SWS modules to identify the elements in these expressions. The lta, variable in turn, is identifying the variable with low variation over time according to the technical unit. Current AQUASTAT Variables Variables are AQUASTAT elements that are non-calculated. These can be frm different sources as described in the table below. Table .: The SWS aquastat_reference data table.
