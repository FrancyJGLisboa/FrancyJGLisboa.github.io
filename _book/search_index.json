The module, therefore, seeks to fullfill AQUASTAT demands described below. 1.1.1 Add indicators The datasets used as input by the faoswsAquastatBaseline module is free from AQUASTAT indicators/derived variables. Thus, the first motivation of the module is to bring indicators up by applying the calculation rules provided by the technical unit and store in the SWS as the calculation_rule data table. Below the description of the AQUASTAT calculation_rule data table.

Services Water Use Efficiency]*[Municipal water withdrawal as % of total withdrawal]) 1.1.2 Long-term variables According to the technical unit, there a set of AQUASTAT variables and indicators that should have the same value over time. These variables are called by the technical unit Long-term average variables and are shown in the table below. Table 1.2: The Long-term average variables in AQUASTAT element_code element_name disseminated calculated Source source 4150 Long-term average annual precipitation in volume D C C DERIVED 4151 Long-term average annual precipitation in depth D V O DERIVED 4154 Groundwater produced internally D V A AQUASTAT 4155 Surface water produced internally D V A AQUASTAT 4156 Overlap between surface water and groundwater D V A AQUASTAT 4157 Total internal renewable water resources (IRWR) D C C DERIVED 4159 Surface water: entering the country (total) D V A AQUASTAT 4160 Surface water: inflow not submitted to treaties D V A AQUASTAT 4161 Surface water: inflow submitted to treaties D V A AQUASTAT 4162 Surface water: inflow secured through treaties D V A AQUASTAT 4164 Surface water: accounted inflow D C C DERIVED 4165 Surface water: total flow of border rivers D V A AQUASTAT 4168 Surface water: accounted flow of border rivers D V A AQUASTAT 4171 Surface water: leaving the country to other countries (total) D V A AQUASTAT 4172 Surface water: outflow to other countries not submitted to treaties D V A AQUASTAT 4173 Surface water: outflow to other countries submitted to treaties D V A AQUASTAT 4174 Surface water: outflow to other countries secured through treaties D V A AQUASTAT 4176 Surface water: total external renewable D C C DERIVED 4177 Groundwater: entering the country (total) D V A AQUASTAT 4178 Groundwater: leaving the country to other countries (total) D V A AQUASTAT 4182 Water resources: total external renewable D C C DERIVED 4185 Total renewable surface water D C C DERIVED 4187 Total renewable groundwater D C C DERIVED 4188 Total renewable water resources D C C DERIVED 4192 Dependency ratio D C C DERIVED 4193 Exploitable: regular renewable surface water D V A AQUASTAT 4194 Exploitable: irregular renewable surface water D V A AQUASTAT 4195 Exploitable: regular renewable groundwater D V A AQUASTAT 4196 Total exploitable water resources D C C DERIVED 4452 Groundwater: accounted inflow D V A AQUASTAT 4453 Groundwater: accounted outflow to other countries D V A AQUASTAT 4509 Exploitable: total renewable surface water D C C DERIVED 4536 Overlap: between surface water and groundwater D C C DERIVED 4549 Environmental Flow Requirements D V O UNKNOWN Thus, the second motivation of the module is to ensure the correct value of the Long-term variable in the final output. 1.1.3 Time-Series completeness One of the main criticisms at the AQUASTAT database is the low level of completeness of the variable/indicators time-series. In fact, water data collection and standardization are not simple tasks due to the high fragmentation and scarcity of the water information at multiple spatial scales. According to the technical unit, on top of the inherent challenges to obtain reliable water data, there has also been a long period of humman resources shortage. These issues eventually hinder the timely collection, processing, and dissemination data and ultimately have been leading to lack of the harmonization between countries in terms of time-series length across several AQUASTAT variables and indicators. To solve this problem, and at the same time respect the variable/indicator characteristics, the ESS - SWS team has proposed the application of imputation methods to increase time-series completeness of AQUASTAT variables and indicators. Through meetings with the technical unit, it was agreed that due to the nature of AQUASTAT variables showing little to moderate variation over time, the imputation mehtods of choice would be Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) and Linear Interpolation. Therefore, the third motivation of the module is to increase the time-series completness of each variable/indicator 1.1.4 Geographic coverage Having aggred on the imputation methods to be applied to AQUASTAT variables/indicators, the obvious expected consequence of the imputations is the possibility of increasing the geographic coverage of important indicators such as the SDGs 6.4.1 (Water USe Efficiency) and 6.4.2 (Water Stress). Therefore, the fourth motivation of the module is the paved the way for the aggregation of SDG indicators at regional and global levels. 1.1.5 FAOSTAT data sourcing The technical unit has been re-disseminating FAOSTAT data as a way to provide supporting statistics in a single data dissemination platform. From a data processing perspective, an effective way to streamline the use of FAOSTAT data by AQUATSAT would be to take the data from datasets already residing in other SWS statistical domains. However, it has been proven to be problematic because the SWS datasets where the FAOSTAT data were suppose to be are actually empty. Currently, the AQUASTAT focal point responsible for the updates of the AQUASTAT working system has been proceed as follow: Downloading normalized data from FAOSTAT; Mapping FAOSTAT code to AQUASTAT code; Uploading the recoded FAOSTAT data into the AQUASTAT working System. To avoid the manual download -&gt; mapping -&gt; upload the module is also automatically harversting the FAOSTAT data from the FAOSTAT website. The FAOSTAT code to AQUASTAT code mapping is done by using the information stored in the aquastat_faostat_mapping data table. Table 1.3: FAOSTAT-to-AQUASTAT mapping aqua_element_code element_name item_code element_code element_code_sws 4100 Total area of the country 6600 5110 5115 4101 Arable land area 6621 5110 5710 4102 Permanent crops area 6650 5110 5011 4103 Cultivated area (arable land + permanent crops) 6620 5110 5522 4104 Total population 3010 511 511 4105 Rural population 3010 551 551 4106 Urban population 3010 561 561 4558 GDP Deflator (2015) 22024 6107 9999 4559 Land area 6601 5110 6601 4560 Inland waters 6680 5110 6680 1.2 Workflow After having seen the main motivations of the faoswsAquastatBaseline module, its workflow can be divided into five main steps: FAOSTAT Annexation Calculation Imputation Recalculation Flag mapping 1.2.1 FAOSTAT annexation Get FAOSTAT data from FAOSTAT website and mapping them to AQUASATAT code using the aquastat_faostat_mapping data table; Downlaod the dataset aquastat_enr from SWS (no indicators in the dataset); Annex the recoded FAOSTAT data to the AQUASTAT aquastat_enr dataset to form a single dataset used as input in the next steps of the faoswsAquastatBaseline Workflow. ## Loading required package: DiagrammeR Figure 1.1: FAOSTAT annexation to AQUASTAT SWS data 1.2.2 Calculation Pass the resulting dataset from the FAOSTAT annexation into the prep_for_calculation function in order to: Get all aquastat variables and indicators from the calculation rules in the calculation_rule data table; Check and collect variables and/or indicators that do not exist in the dataset. Add the detected missing variables and/or indicators to the dataset in order to avoid crash when applying calculation rules; According to AQUASTAT focal point, before calculations all variables belonging to calculation rules representing addiction or subtraction MUST be converted to zero IF their respective time-series are completely empty. Below the variables pre-defined by AQUASTAT for which this is applicable. Table 1.4: AQUASTAT variables with missing values made zero before calculations IF the time-series was fully empty element_code element_name disseminated calculated Source source 4264 Desalinated water produced D V A AQUASTAT 4265 Direct use of treated municipal wastewater D V A AQUASTAT 4308 Area equipped for full control irrigation: surface irrigation D V A AQUASTAT 4309 Area equipped for full control irrigation: sprinkler irrigation D V A AQUASTAT 4310 Area equipped for full control irrigation: localized irrigation D V A AQUASTAT 4312 Area equipped for irrigation: equipped lowland areas D V A AQUASTAT 4314 Flood recession cropping area non-equipped D V A AQUASTAT 4315 Cultivated wetlands and inland valley bottoms non-equipped D V A AQUASTAT 4316 Area equipped for irrigation: spate irrigation D V A AQUASTAT 4451 Direct use of agricultural drainage water D V A AQUASTAT Calculation of indicators by applying the information in the calculation_rule data table (see Table 1.1); After calculations, replace missing values (NAs) by the value of primary variable of the indicator when applicable following the rule: IF indicator/derived variable is empty after the caculation and its correspondent primary variable is avaialble, replace the missing value of the indicator by the value of the primary variable. Table 1.5: Indicators which the primary variable rule was applied to after the calculations indicator_code indicator_description primary_variable_code primary_variable_description 4263 Total freshwater withdrawal (primary and secondary) 4253 Total water withdrawal 4311 Area equipped for full control irrigation: total 4308 Area equipped for full control irrigation: surface irrigation 4313 Area equipped for irrigation: total 4311 Area equipped for full control irrigation: total 4317 Total agricultural water managed area 4313 Area equipped for irrigation: total 4459 Area equipped for full control irrigation: pressurized (sprinkler + localized) 4309 Area equipped for full control irrigation: sprinkler irrigation Figure 1.2: AQUASTAT Calculation using SWS calculation_rule data table. 1.2.3 Imputations The calculation step added new indicators but did not solve the issue of time-series completeness. The Imputation step comes in to: Expand variables and indicators time-series from the first observed value until 2018 as agreed by the technical unit; Fill the generated missing values using the following guideline: Apply Last Observation Carried Forward to missing values in time-series where the observed values DO NOT VARY; Apply Last Observation Carried Forward to missing values in time-series of Long-Term average variables (see Table 1.2 for reference); Apply Last Observation Carried Forward to missing values in time-series with only one observed value; Apply Linear Interpolation to missing values in time-series with two or more different observed values. Figure 1.3: AQUASTAT Imputations using the data resulting from the calculation step. 1.2.4 Recalculation The completeness brought by imputations is used by the recalculation step to replace indicator imputed values by calculated values. To do so, the recalculation step: Takes the imputed dataset resulting from the Imputation step; Applies the calculation rules to the imputed dataset with the help of the calculation_rule data table (Table 1.1); Re-applies the primary variable variable rule using the variables in the Table 1.1; Replace indicators brought by imputations by values brought by the recalculation when applicable. Figure 1.4: Recalculations using imputed dataset and the calculation_rule data table. 1.2.5 Flag mapping (Observation) The mapping between the original flags in AQUASTAT to valid flags in the SWS was made possible with the following conversions: Table 1.6: AQUASTAT to SWS flag conversion flagAquastat flagAquastat_SWS E X K E L E I E F E M I blank blank Besides the basic conversion described above, values emerged from the faoswsAquastatBaseline module processing were flagged according as follow: All indicators emerging from calculations/recalculations have SWS flag ‘E’; All missing values filled by the imputations have SWS flag ‘I’. 1.2.6 Flag mapping (Method) With regard to flag of methods in SWS, the conversion following criteria: When the value is imputed from the module AND the imputation method is LOCF, the flag method is ‘t’; When the value is imputed from the module and the method is LOCF, the flag of method is ‘e’; When the value is calculated or recalculated the flag of method is ‘i’. When the value has flagObservationStatus ‘E’ and DOES NOT COME FROM PROCESSING, the flag of method is ‘-’; When the value has flagObservationStatus blank and DOES NOT COME FROM PROCESSING, the flag of method is ‘p’ ; When the value has flagObservationStatus ‘X’ and DOES NOT COME FROM PROCESSING, the flag of method is ‘c’; Table 1.7: flagObservationStatus - flagMethod combination brought by the faoswsAquastatBaseline module flagObservationStatus flagMethod X c I t I e E i E - blank p 1.3 Running the module in the SWS To run the faoswsAquastatBaseline after any updated of either aquastat_enr SWS dataset or FAOSTAT - based variables, the user need to: Login in the SWS; Click on New Query; Select Aquastat domain and Aquastat Baseline dataset; Select all countries, all elements, and all years; Figure 1.5: Aquastat baseline query Click on the Run button to query the data; After running the query the user will see an empty session waiting for being populated by the module; Figure 1.6: Aquastat baseline empty session Click on the Run plugin button and then select the faoswsAquastatBaseline module Figure 1.7: Select Aquastat baseline module Once the user has selected the faoswsAquastatBaseline plugin, click on the button Run plugin; Figure 1.8: Run Aquastat baseline module The module will start and the user should wait for the output.
